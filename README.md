# Tree Segmentation

The goal of this project is to develop a method to **segment and identify trees using remote sensing data**. The two main types of data will be RGB **images** (or other wave lengths) and **LiDAR** point clouds. The main focus of the project will be to properly identify and separate each **individual tree**, even in dense forests. Then, we should be able to extract information about each individual tree, such as its **height**, its **shape** or its **species** (starting only with deciduous and evergreen).
