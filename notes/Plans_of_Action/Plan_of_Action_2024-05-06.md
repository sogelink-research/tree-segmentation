# Plan of Action (May 6 2024)

## Last week

There is not much to say about what I did last week. Nothing fancy, I simply added annotations to the dataset I am currently creating, which didn't go very fast since I focused on some difficult regions. I also finished the pre-processing of the point clouds to make them compatible with the size of images I chose.

## Next goals

AS for next week, the goal is to keep working on the same two tasks and hope to finish them quickly:

- Complete the tree dataset with bounding boxes (I might give up on some small areas where trees are really hard to distinguish),
- Put everything together to have the PyTorch model working (at least having all the elements for the `forward` function).
